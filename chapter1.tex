\exercise %1.1
Explain in one paragraph at least three levels
of abstraction that are used by
\begin{tasks}(2)
	\task biologists studying the operation of cells
	\task chemists studying the composition of matter	
\end{tasks}
\solution
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Cells consist of \emph{atoms}. Atoms form special molecules known as 
\emph{amino acids}. These are used by the cell to create \emph{enzymes}. 
\item There are a lot of \emph{quarks}, which (in threes) form basic particles
such as neutrons, electrons, protons, anti-protons, positrons. If you then
take a number of neutrons, electrons and protons, you get an atom.
\end{enumerate}

\exercise %1.2
Explain in one paragraph how the techniques of hiearchy, modularity,
and regularity may be used by
\begin{tasks}(2)
	\task automobile designers
	\task businesses to manage their operations
\end{tasks}
\solution
\todo{1.2}

\exercise %1.3
Ben Bitdiddle is building a house. Explain how he can use the principle
of \emph{hiearchy}, \emph{modularity}, and \emph{regularity} to save time 
and money during construction
\solution
First, let's define the terms used here:
\begin{description}
	\item[Hiearchy] dividing a system into modules
	\item[Modularity] modules can be used without having to understand
	how they work inside
	\item[Regularity] modules can be reused easily
\end{description}
\todo{1.3}

\exercise
An analog voltage is in the range of 0-5$V$. If it can be measured with
an accuracy of $\pm 50mV$, at most how many bits of information does it convey?
\solution
If the analog voltage can be measured with an accuracy of $\pm 50mV$, then
it can only accurately be measured to the nearest $100mV$. This means that
between $0mV$ and $5,000mV$, it can take on 50 differentiable
values:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{5,000\mathrm{mV}}{100\mathrm{mV}}=50	
\end{equation*}
Since you need $log_2(n)$ bits to be able to differentiate between $n$
Values, the analog voltage has $log_2(50) \approx 5.64$ bits of information, 
so it conveys at most 6 bits of information.

\exercise
A classroom has an old clock on the wall whose minute hand broke off.
\begin{tasks}
	\task If you can read the hour hand to the nearest 15 minutes, how many
	bits of information does the clock convey about time?
	\task If you know whether it is before or after noon, how many additional
	bits of information do you know about the time?	
\end{tasks}
\solution
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item An hour has 60 minutes, if you know the time to the nearest
	minute that makes 4 different states. Then there are 12 hours per day,
	which makes a total of $12*4=48$ different states. Using $log_2(n)$,
	that makes $log_2(48) \approx 5.58$ bits of information.
	\item If you know whether it is before or after noon, that makes two
	states, and that is exactly one bit. So by knowing that, you know
	one additional bit about the time.
\end{enumerate}

\exercise
The babylonians developed the \emph{sexagesimal} (base 60) number system
about 4000 years ago. How many bits of information is conveyed with one
sexagesimal digit? How do you write the number $4000_{10}$ in sexagesimal?
\solution
Just like we have ten digits ($0..9$) in base 10, they had sixty digits in
their number system. Since there are sixty different digit, one single one
of them conveys $log_2(60) \approx \mathbf{5.91}$ bits of information. 
Converting numbers can be done just like in any other number system:
\begin{align*}
4000 / 60 & = 66 \: \mathtt{rem} \: 40 \\
66 / 60 & = 1 \: \mathtt{rem} \: 6 \\
1 / 60 & = 0 \: \mathtt{rem} \: 1	
\end{align*}
By reading the remainders off, the number is: $1 \cdot 60^2+6 \cdot 60^1+40
\cdot 60^0$.

\exercise
How many different numbers can be represented with 16 bits?
\solution
$2^{16}=65536$ numbers can be represented with 16 bits.

\exercise
What is the largest unsigned 32-bit number?
\solution

32-bit numbers and the first one is $0$.
